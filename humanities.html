  <h4>Humanities Puzzles</h4>	
  <br>
  <p>Tim was on track for Gliese 581. He had a very important ExtraSuperUROP project to complete there, and he was running a little late. So when his spaceship started making a few concerning sounds, he shrugged it off: he could run some diagnostics after his project was done. He wasn’t prepared for how quickly the noises would get worse. Or for the steering to cut out -- right as a planet loomed up in front of him. No matter how hard he pulled the emergency brake, nothing happened. And the planet was getting closer and closer… He closed his eyes and hoped for the best.</p>	
      <p>Boom!</p>	
      <p>He opened his eyes to a wide brown sky. To his left was nothing but dust and dirt. To his right was his spaceship. Or what used to be his spaceship; now it was more like a pile of parts. And behind him--</p>	
      <p>“Ahhh!”</p>	
      <p>Behind him were five creatures. Five aliens! One of them opened its mouth and said... “brrbflx”?</p>	
      <p>“Hi, uh, sorry, I don’t know what that means. Who are you? Can you help me fix my spaceship?”</p>	
      <p>“Brrbflx!”</p>	
      <p>Tim had a feeling it was going to be a looooooong time before he saw MIT again. </p>
